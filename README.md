# Pit Viper Web Scraper

Why the name Pit Viper? Well...

<p style="font-size: 24px;"> "Pit Vipers sense infrared, allowing it to seek and destroy it's prey." </p>

At the time of this project's creation I needed to find work. I decided rather than manually searching, I would create a series of projects which would help me to not only locate a job, but also give me something to demonstrate.

## Project Goals:
* Web Scrape based upon easily interchangeable behaviours.
* Adhere to SOLID principles.
* Abstraction is key to allow for the project to be reused in future.
* Adjust operation based upon sitemap.xml and robots.txt contents.
* Mimic human behaviour and allow easy compatibility with proxies.
* Follow a Test Driven Development process.

## Tech Stack
* Python 3.
* Poetry.
* Beautiful Soup.
